# **Text File Compressor**

This Project is used to reduce file length using Huffman coding.

## **Working**

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. 

#### There are mainly two major parts in Huffman Coding

- Build a Huffman Tree from input characters.
- Traverse the Huffman Tree and assign codes to characters.

#### Here is an illustration of how the system functions:
